# juegoJS
1- HTML is created in this case we wanted to do it with 3 pages. 1 for the welcome part, 2 for the playability part and 3 for the farewell part.

2- the CSS is created and linked to each page respectively and the style changes are made along with its responsive mode.

3- the JS is created where the respective script was made, there were linking problems, so one part is in the JS file and another part in the HTML files.
